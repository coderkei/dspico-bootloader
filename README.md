# DSpico Bootloader
This is the repository for the DSpico Bootloader. It is a small NDS rom that initializes the DSpico and uses [Pico Loader](https://github.com/LNH-team/pico-loader) to boot the nds file at `fat:/_picoboot.nds`.

## Setup & configuration
We recommend using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), MSYS2 or Unix-based machine to compile this repository.
The steps provided will assume you already have one of those environments set up.

1. Install [BlocksDS](https://blocksds.skylyrac.net/docs/setup/).
2. To be able to use this bootloader, compile [Pico Loader](https://github.com/LNH-team/pico-loader) and place the files on your SD card.
3. Place the rom to boot on the root of your SD card as `_picoboot.nds`.

## Compiling
1. Compile the bootloader by running `make`
2. Patch `BOOTLOADER.nds` with the [DSpico DLDI driver](https://github.com/LNH-team/dspico-dldi) using [dlditool](https://www.chishm.com/DLDI/):
    - `dlditool DSpico.dldi BOOTLOADER.nds`
3. Prepare `BOOTLOADER.nds` for use on a cartridge using [DSRomEncryptor](https://github.com/Gericom/DSRomEncryptor):
    - `DSRomEncryptor BOOTLOADER.nds BOOTLOADER.nds`
    - Note that this requires the ntr and twl blowfish keys (see also the readme of DSRomEncryptor) and [.NET 9.0](`https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-install?tabs=dotnet9&pivots=os-linux-ubuntu-2404`)
4. Rename `BOOTLOADER.nds` to `default.nds` and place it in the `roms` folder of the [DSpico Firmware](https://github.com/LNH-team/dspico-firmware)
5. Compile the DSpico Firmware and flash it to the DSpico
